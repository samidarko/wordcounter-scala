Greek and Roman philosophers did not recognize philosophy of mind as a distinct field of study.
However, topics now considered central to philosophy of mind such as perception, imagination, thought, intelligence, emotion, memory, identity, and action were often discussed under the title "Peri psychÃªs or On the Soul".
This article surveys some of the ideas held by the ancient Stoics addressing the soul and related topics which roughly correspond to themes prevalent in contemporary philosophy of mind and philosophical psychology.

The ancient Greek concept of soul differs in many ways from the modern idea of mind. [True???]
Contemporary thinkers' tend to sharply contrast the mind and body.
When we think of mind we think primarily of cognitive faculties and perhaps our sense of identity.
The Greek concept of the soul is much broader and more closely connected to basic bodily functions.
